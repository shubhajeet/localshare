	ABOUT

	This is a project that hopes to avoid the use of the pendrive
	or any other third party device while trying to transfer file
	from one computer to another. This is not a sophisticated program
	but uses a shell script that utilises netcat, tar and other 
	software to accomplish the task.

	This project hopes to bring transfering file using wifi or local 
	network to general people by simplifying it.
